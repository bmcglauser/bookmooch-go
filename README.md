# Welcome to BookMooch Go
BookMooch Go is a mobile-optimized portal for BookMooch.com, a successful global book-swapping site with over 300,000 registered users. Currently the site has no user-friendly option for mobile, and I wanted to fix that :)

*Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Sass, GraphQL with Apollo, JWT, and BookMooch's own public API exposing their MySQL database*

Check out a demo here:

## Getting Started
If you're interested in getting BookMooch Go up and running on your own machine, follow the steps below and you'll be able to use your own BookMooch account:

1. Clone this repo onto your computer:
- `git clone https://github.com/bmcglauser/bookmooch-go`
2. Enter the directory:
- `cd bookmooch-go`
3. Install dependencies and start the server, using localhost:4000:
- `cd server && npm install`
- `npm run start`
on success, you should get a console output of `ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/`
4. Open another terminal in the directory and do the same for the client:
- `cd client && npm install`
- `npm run start`
5. A window will automatically open with the client, but in a distorted desktop view. Open the developer tools. Select 'Toggle device toolbar' from the Elements tab, in the upper left of the panel. Select a mobile device at the top of the window (I designed using iPhone X). Then, navigate away from localhost to any other page. Return to localhost:3000 *using the address bar* - please note clicking 'Back' to return will not prompt the browser to automatically resize.
6. You are now ready to explore the full extent of Bookmooch Go. Enjoy!
